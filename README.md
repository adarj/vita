## Introduction

The PS Vita exposes a quite comprehensive library of kernel functions
that provide much of the features needed for a Rust program to work.
As such, this crate intends to expose them to developers in an
interface mimicking the `std` crate, allowing `std` code to be compiled
for the PS Vita.

## Usage

Add this crate to `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
vita = '^0.1'
```

## Cross-compiling

You'll need to have the `armv7-vita-eabihf` target specification in your
`$RUST_TARGET_PATH`. If you don't have it, you can find it in its
dedicated [git repository](https://github.com/vita-rust/common). Then,
you can use [`xargo`](https://github.com/japaric/xargo) to cross-compile.

You'll also need to have the [`vitasdk`](https://vitasdk.org) set up and
the `$VITASDK` environment variable set. See the [`psp2-sys`](https://github.com/vita-rust/psp2-sys)
repository for more details.
